# Mantra App Restoration Plan

This document outlines the steps to restore the Mantra application to its original, production-ready state by removing the demo-specific features.

## Analysis

The `src/App.tsx` file was modified to include a "test mode" for demonstration purposes. This includes a state variable (`isTestMode`), a function to trigger a test popup (`triggerTestPopup`), and a "Test Now" button in the UI.

## Proposed Changes

To restore the application, the following changes will be made to `src/App.tsx`:

1.  **Remove Test-Related Code:**
    *   Eliminate the `isTestMode` state variable.
    *   Delete the `triggerTestPopup` function.
    *   Remove the "Test Now" button from the user interface.
    *   Remove the conditional check for `isTestMode` within the `checkTime` function.

2.  **Review Time Logic:**
    *   The hardcoded reminder times (14:22 and 18:44) and the two-hour time adjustment will be preserved, as they appear to be part of the core application logic.
